                            <p>This design challenge is part of my Web Design and Usability course from NAIT&apos;s
                                (former) Digital Media and I.T. program. </p>

                            <p className="italic text-h6 mt-1">&quot;Anthony would like you to design a landing page that would help <strong>engage</strong> visitors enough to regularly use his website for their recipe needs.&quot;</p>

                        </ProjectDetailSection>

                        <ProjectDetailSection title={"Ideation"}>
                            <p>On my research phase, I looked at popular recipe sites (like Tasty) and noted some design patterns. The websites I used for inspirations had common patterns like friendly faces, mouth-watering food images, recipe categories, and featured recipes from contributors.</p>


                            <p>And to keep the users engaged and encourage regular visitation, I decided to implement sections on the landing page that can potentially increase conversion. Sections include...</p>

                            <ol className="list-decimal pl-1">
                                <li>Weekly Featured Recipes</li>
                                <li>A call-to-action for users/community members to submit their recipes</li>
                                <li>Recipe catalogue section</li>
                                <li>A brief introduction to Chef Anthony</li>
                            </ol>
                        </ProjectDetailSection>


                        <ProjectDetailSection title={"Branding"}>

                            <p>My goal for the branding for Anthony&apos;s Kitchen to evoke a sense of as warmth and approachability. Hence, I opted to use a friendly second-person voice for the heading texts as if Anthony itself is talking to the users. </p>

                            <h4>Logo Story</h4>
                            <p>The logo features the brand name ‚Äúanthony‚Äôs kitchen‚Äù in a cursive font like it was handwritten. It evokes a sense of &quot;personal touch&quot;, which reflects the overall purpose of the website‚Äî a platform where people can share their personal recipes. Behind the text is a chef‚Äôs hat adding a playful visual cue that signals that the website is all about food.</p>

                                <p>For the visual communication, I used warm pastel colors for a minimal and clean look. I also incorporated a lot of organic shapes to bring softness to the UI.</p>
